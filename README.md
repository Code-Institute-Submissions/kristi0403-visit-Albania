# Welcome to Albania website

This website is designed as a touristic guide to Albania. It was an idea of pupblicity when the website was starting to develope at the begining as the website itself shows the most beautiful places of the country
 , activities you can do, food and tradicions, historical information, new experiences. It is build in a way that gives you enough information to introduce you to Albania but at the same time making you want to know more and why not visit it.
 It shows a map at the begining with all the main touristic cities. Each name of the map is a gate to take you to the location and it openes what is worthy to see and do near the location you presed. It alsow provides a section called activities with all the activities you wish to do 
 like if you are a sport-lover or an extreme sport-lover or you just liket to explore the nature and sea the wild habitats that provide varius flora and fauna elements. Or you just love food and you want to try the specialities that are a lot for each region . 
 Or you just like history and want to hare it told inside the museums and by the remains of the cities and temples and amphiteaters build thousand years ago where the history of Albania was engraved...
