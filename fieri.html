                  of the Aous River . Its ruins are situated in the Fier region, near
                  the village of Pojani. Apollonia was founded in 588 BCE , on a site
                  initially occupied by Illyrian tribes. Apollonia was home to a
                  renowned school of philosophy.

                  Located at only a 20-minute drive from Fier are the Ardenica hills,
                  famous for the Monastery of the Nativity of the Theotokos and many
                  breathtaking landscapes. A pagan temple dedicated to the goddess
                  Artemis had existed where the Monastery sits now, which explains the
                  origin of it's name.

                  Beyond all its historical and cultural values, the Monastery is well
                  worth visiting for the scenery that surrounds its strategic
                  position. Form here, you get a view over the Adriatic Sea, the
                  Lagoon of Karavasta, Mount Tomorr and the Dajti Mountain.
