          <h6>Dardha village of Korca</h6>
          <p class="text-block">
            The name Dardha, meaning “pear” in Albanian, refers to a wild pear
            tree that became a landmark of the area. When people first asked the
            initial residents of the village where they lived, they would always
            answer “near the pear tree,” and, thus, the name was born.

            While during the winter Dardha is covered in white, the three
            remaining seasons also display such a rich variety of colors that
            you instantly realize why so many important Albanian painters and
            artists hail from this place.

            bar inside Avenue 55, easily the best in town.

            After a hot long summer and an unusually warm autumn and no rain at
            all, the first snowfall hit southeastern Albania during the weekend.
            It has been common since a few years for the seasons in Albania to
            switch from summer to winter and from winter to summer.
